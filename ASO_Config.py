ASO_GENERAL_GUIDELINES = f""" General Translation Guidelines:

The tone should be:
- Fun, playful, and energetic
- Casual and approachable
- Clear, concise, and engaging for players

You must:
- Use natural, idiomatic language for the target audience
- Prioritize clarity and emotional appeal over literal translation
- Maintain consistent tone and phrasing across all content
- Stay within any provided character limits

If the English text includes puns, idioms, or culturally specific phrases:
- Adapt them to something that feels native and engaging in the target language
- It's okay to rephrase for clarity or punch — fun and fluid is better than literal

Avoid:
- Overly formal or technical phrasing
- Translating idioms or jokes literally if they don’t work in the target language

Players create their own witch or wizard, attend classes, build friendships, and take part in limited-time quests inspired by seasons, holidays, and Wizarding World lore.

    Tone: Keep copy short, hype-driven, and “magical” (e.g., celebrate, unlock, nurture, discover) while sounding warm and inclusive.

    Proper nouns & spells: Preserve every franchise term exactly as it appears in the official localized Wizarding World canon for your language. Examples: Hufflepuff → Poufsouffle (FR), Diagon Alley → Chemin de Traverse (FR). Do not alter house names, character names, spells, or location names.

    What can change: Ordinary adjectives, verbs, and connective text may be freely adapted to fit local style and store character limits.""",
